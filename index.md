## Coming Fall 2020...

Our Lady of Perpetual Hope is a Homeschool Hybrid that combines the best elements of homeschool and a traditional classroom setting to provide a Classical Catholic education. We are affiliated with [Saint Ambrose Academy](https://www.saintambroseacademy.org) and will be meeting at Saint Alphonsus Liguori in Zionsville, Indiana. 

More details to come very soon...
