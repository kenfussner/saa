## Coming Fall 2020...

Our Lady of Perpetual Help is a Homeschool Hybrid that combines the best elements of homeschool and a traditional classroom setting to provide a Classical Catholic education. We are affiliated with [Saint Ambrose Academy](https://www.saintambroseacademy.org) and will be meeting at Saint Alphonsus Liguori in _Zionsville, Indiana_.
